# FaDe-Net


> Fake Detection Network

### current goals  
   - start preprocessing data
   - build architecture
   - research and perform tune appropreiateley 

### novel way to classify news and prevent
   - LSTM with Attention Mech
   - with embeddings
   - mainstream media
### workflow
   - prototype in jupyter notebooks 
   -- one shot encoding 
   - train, test, clean data files 
   
### decisions 
   - build network from scratch?
   - use sklearn or TF 
   - automation of variables 
   
### LOG
   - Look into how README.md are formatted for code papers
   - read paperswithcode.com
